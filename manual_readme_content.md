When completing the asset configuration, there's a field called **environment** . The easiest way to
find the value for this field is to take a look at the URL you use to access the platform, which
should be of the form:  
https://service. **\[environment\]** .sumologic.com/ and extract it from there.

  

## Considerations for Ingestion

When running scheduled polling, the start time is from when the previous one ended. There is also a
limit of 10,000 messages which can be received per each poll.  
With these two factors in mind, it is best to keep your **poll interval** small enough that you
would expect to receive less than the configured **Max Messages** in that interval, or else there
will be messages which won't be ingested.  
If there are still too many messages being received in a smaller time interval, consider creating
multiple assets with more specific queries.
