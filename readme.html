<p>When completing the asset configuration, there's a field called <b>environment</b>.  The easiest way to find the value for this field is to take a look at the URL you use to access the platform, which should be of the form:<br>
https://service.<b>[environment]</b>.sumologic.com/ and extract it from there.</p><br>

<h2 id="considerations">Considerations for Ingestion</h2>
<p>
When running scheduled polling, the start time is from when the previous one ended. There is also a limit of 10,000 messages which can be received per each poll.<br>
With these two factors in mind, it is best to keep your <b>poll interval</b> small enough that you would expect to receive less than the configured <b>Max Messages</b> in that interval, or else there will be messages which won't be ingested.<br>
If there are still too many messages being received in a smaller time interval, consider creating multiple assets with more specific queries.<br>
